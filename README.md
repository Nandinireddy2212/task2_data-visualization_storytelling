- CSV file (datset)

## Objective

- Analyze and visualize sales and operational data from the Superstore dataset.

## Business Insights

- **Sales Trends** show strong year-over-year growth after 2015, indicating successful strategic improvements.
- **Product Profitability** analysis reveals that Tables and Bookcases consistently result in losses, while Copiers and Phones are the most profitable.
- **Regional Sales** are dominated by the West and East, with the Consumer and Corporate segments leading across all regions.
- **Shipping Performance** shows that Standard Class drives most sales but also suffers from the longest delivery delays.
- **Top 10 Customers** contribute nearly 20% of total profit and should be targeted for retention and loyalty initiatives.
- **Customer-Level Profitability** shows clusters of underperforming customers that require review, while the Consumer segment accounts for over half of all sales.
- The **Executive Storyboard Page** consolidates KPIs, trends, and insights into a single, actionable dashboard to support business decisions.


## Recommendations

1. **Re-evaluate Loss-Making Products** - Tables and Bookcases show consistent losses. Review their pricing, supplier costs, or discount strategies to minimize negative impact on overall profitability.

2. **Strengthen Focus on Profitable Categories** - Copiers and Phones are top profit contributors. Expand marketing efforts and optimize stock to increase revenue from these high-margin products.

3. **Improve Standard Class Shipping Efficiency** - Although Standard Class generates the highest sales, it also has the longest delays. Streamlining this shipping mode could enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

4. **Engage Top 10 Customers Strategically** - The top 10 customers contribute nearly 20% of total profit. Consider personalized offers, loyalty programs, or account-based marketing to retain them.

5. **Explore Growth Opportunities in Underperforming Regions** - Central and South regions contribute less to overall sales. Run targeted campaigns or promotions to unlock potential in these markets.
